I am a front end and back end developer and a designer â˜• <br/>
But more than that I am a learner ðŸ’»

ðŸ’¬ Currently studying Digital Design, I like aligning both my knowledge in design and development. As a knowledge sharer enthusiast, I love working synergically. My most important value is constant learning and that enabled me to have a grasp from graphic design to mainframe development. <br>

I love learning about  React, JavaScript, TypeScript, React Native, Node.js, Java, Angular, and Python. Professionally, I've worked both as back-end developer, having worked with C#, NATURAL and ADABAS, and as a front-end developer, having worked with React and JavaScript. <br>

:purple_heart: In my free time, I like watching queer films, Hacks and other TV Shows, too.
