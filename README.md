## Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developer and a designer â˜• <br/>
But more than that I am a learner ðŸ’»

ðŸ’¬ Currently studying Digital Design, I like aligning both my knowledge in design and development. As a knowledge sharer enthusiast, I love working synergically. My most important value is constant learning and that enabled me to have a grasp from graphic design to mainframe development. <br>

I love learning about Java, Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.JS, React Native, Node.JS and Python. Professionally, I've always been a back-end developer, having worked with C#, JavaScript for Dynamics 365, NATURAL, ADABAS, Java and Angular. <br>

:purple_heart: In my free time, I like watching Old Hollywood films, British soup opera and TV Shows
